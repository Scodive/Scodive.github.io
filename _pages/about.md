Hi, I am Hengle Jiang. I am a PhD student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Ke Tang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/tangke.html). I obtained my B.Eng. degree from the same department, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Qi Hao](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~haoq/) and Dr. Dachuan Li. I am also a research intern at [MINSys Group](https://xmouyang.github.io/Team/) @ HKUST CSE, supervised by [Prof. Xiaomin Ouyang](https://xmouyang.github.io). 

My research interest mainly includes Agentic AI, real-world applications of large models, and Autonomous driving.

I'm always open to collaboration! If you have a research idea or want to work together in any project, feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect (hjiangbg@connect.ust.hk).
